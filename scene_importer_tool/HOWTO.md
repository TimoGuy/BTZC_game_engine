# Scene Importer Tool.

This is a simple tool to convert Unity scenes to BTZC scenes.

@NOTE: This is not a feature-complete tool, but rather something to copy over meshes and objects.


## Usage.

```
cd scene_importer_tool
py -m venv venv
cd venv/Scripts
activate
cd ../..
pip install -r requirements.txt
py ./scene_importer.py sample_scene.unity sample_scene.btzc
```
